"This technique project is going to explore SwiftData in more detail, starting with a summary of some basic techniques then building up to tackling some more complex problems.

As you'll see, `SwiftData` really pushes hard on advanced features of both Swift and SwiftUI, all to help make it easy for us to store data efficiently. It's not always easy, though, and there are a few places that take quite a bit of thinking to use properly."
